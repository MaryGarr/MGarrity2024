# Hello, nice to have you as a guest!

I am Mary E. Garrity, B.S., MBA and I work as a Senior Director of Development in Biomedical and Translational Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I am also a peer-reviewed, published neuroscientist. I received my MBA from Case Western Reserve University and now I am pursuing my PhD in Clinical Translational Science at Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine.

On this website, I offer a glimpse into my vast experience, ongoing research, current research interests and publications.

My research interests are grounded in neuroscience having a background with Cleveland Clinic. I have extensive experience with biomedical companies which I worked to move from laboratories to patient care. I am proud of the time I devoted to the Case-Coulter partnership as the inaugural director building the program that supports translational research at Case Western. The program remains with an endowment and funds translational research projects to bring new therapeutics and medical devices to patients. In addition to this experience, I have worked as an international business development executive.

With more than 15 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, hospitals, non-profit and academic institutions, I like to assist research PIs in the entire process of translating their research to patient care. This includes expertise in regulatory compliance with multinational government agencies, strategic business development, grant writing, funding procurement, oversight of intellectual property transactions, and successfully launching new biomedical companies

I am also a very proud and loving mom to an amazing son. Everything I do, I do it with love for him. Friends, family and career life balance are important but nothing means more to me than my son.
